# Overview
This is simply a learning project implementing the infamous `wish` shell by the authors of the _Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces_ book.
It still contains some bugs (a memory leak, incorrect argument parsing, etc.), but I hate parsing user input so I'm just going to skip it and build something else :> I'm more into the nitty-gritty or the OS internals
